# RIP-AV: Joint Representative Instance Pre-training and Context Aware Network for Retinal Artery/Vein Segmentation 

- Contribution
  1) we introduce a novel deep learning framework, named RIP-AV, is the first attempt to joint local patch with its context in the retinal A/V segmentation.
  2) we design a representative instance learning strategy to learn latent arteriovenous feature. 
  3) we Design two novel moudules Distance Aware and Patch Context Fusion to the relationship of vascular patch and its context.  
  4) Validated against three datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
